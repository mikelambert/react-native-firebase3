# react-native-firebase

Firebase3 includes a great JS API. However, it only covers the web-specific features, leaving the others for the Android and iOS specific SDKs. This wraps the relevant Firebase3 mobile SDKs to expose their features via React Native JS.

Currently, it only includes support for Firebase RemoteConfig, with support for others as I find need of them (or receive pull requests for them).

If you are looking for a React Native wrapper for firebase2 API, you can find that in the react-native-firebase NPM module.
